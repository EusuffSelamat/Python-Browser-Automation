# Python-Browser-Automation

2. [DONE] Provide support for captcha services
3. [DONE] Set the browser configs/preferences to run in an optimal setup
4. [TO DO]Frontend clean and friendly Graphical User Interface

6. [PLAN] Provide support for proxies
    Pros: We can automate our bots with many instances and threads without being blocked or flagged
          In conjunction with a dedicated server and when done right, we are pretty much untraceable
    Cons: High quality proxies are expensive
          Cheap/Free proxies can be saturated, leading to us getting flagged and the connection may be poor
          
6. [PLAN] Run on a dedicated server such that our program runs at a specified time
    Pros: Full automation!
    Cons: More lines of codes need to be written for full automation and error checks so that it requires as little maintenance as possible
